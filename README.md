# Robotics Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Robotics Projects Portfolio!  
This repository contains my hands-on projects on various robotics topics, organized by domain.

## Topics Covered

- **Computer Vision Projects**  
  Projects related to object detection, classification, image processing using modern tools like YOLO.

- **Control Systems Projects**  
  Implementations of classic and advanced controllers like MPC, LQR, and Kalman Filters.

- **SLAM Projects**  
  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using ORB-SLAM3 and related techniques.

- **Dynamics & Kinematics Projects**  
  Robot motion modeling, forward/inverse kinematics, and related simulations.

- **Reinforcement Learning Projects**  
  Applying RL algorithms for robotic control and decision-making.

- **ROS2 Projects**  
  Practical ROS2 applications and robot simulations.

## Big Projects

This portfolio also includes integrated, larger-scale projects combining multiple topics, such as:

- Autonomous Vehicle Control
- Multi-Robot Coordination

## How to Use This Repository

Each topic folder contains individual projects with detailed README files explaining the project goals, implementation, and results. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
